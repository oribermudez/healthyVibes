      <p>
        If you haven’t tried broccoli slaw you’re missing out!.
        I dressed it up with a nutrient-dense dressing I made
        with a handful of cilantro, garlic, spinach, tahini,
        and lemon. As always, feel free to experiment and
        substitute out any of the ingredients to suit your
        tastebuds. You can use this dressing with salads, with
        noodles, or use as a dip for vegetables. Tahini has such
        a nice kick and at 0 net carbs, it’s a great alternative
        to using oil for dressings.
      </p>
      <p>
        To make a large batch of the dressing/pesto:
        <ol>
          <li>
            In a small food processor, I threw in 1 handful of
            fresh cilantro, 1 cup of baby spinach, 2 cloves fresh
            garlic, 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1/4 onion, juice of
            1.5 lemons.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pulsed all of the above together, then added 2
            tablespoonsof tahini.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pulse and pureed everything above and added sea salt,
            pepper, and a little ginger, then ran the food processor
            again.
          </li>
          <li>
            At this point, I did a quick taste of the sauce to see
            if I wanted to season with more salt, add more lemon
            juice, or add more herbs. This all depends on your taste
            buds. I mixed some of it with the slaw and put the rest
            in the fridge.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        To make the shrimp:
        <ol>
          <li>
            I seasoned a handful of large shrimp with sea salt, some
            lemon pepper, smoked paprika, and some red chili flakes.
          </li>
          <li>
            I put the shrimp and sliced mushrooms in a pan on medium
            heat with 1 tablespoon coconut oil and cooked on each side
            until pink (less than 5 mins total).
          </li>
        </ol>
