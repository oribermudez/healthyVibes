      <p>
        News flash: Your glutes exist for better reasons than just looking
        good in jeans. This major muscle group (made up of your gluteus
        maximus, medius, and minimus) is a key player in explosive movements
        like jumping and sprinting. <br />
        A strong butt can also help relieve low back pain and make everyday
        movements — like standing and climbing stairs — that much easier. <br />
        You won’t need any equipment, though you can up the intensity by
        holding medium-weight kettlebells or dumbbells in each hand.<br />
        Perform each exercise for a minute resting up to 30 seconds between
        sets. Complete the full circuit 3 times!

        </div>
        <p>
          Perform a hip drive. Bring left foot forward so you’re kneeling
          on your right knee. Push into your left heel and engage glutes
          to stand, bringing right knee up. As you stand, try not to push
          off the floor. Instead, engage hamstrings and glutes to lift.
          Return to starting position.

        <p>
          Lie faceup with knees bent and feet shoulder-width apart. Raise
          hips straight up off the floor, engaging glutes and bracing core.
          Lower down slowly, creating your own resistance.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>
          Step forward with your right foot. Use glutes, hamstrings, and
          core to lower into a lunge. Lift left foot and step forward,
          immediately dropping into a lunge on the other side. Continue to
          “walk” forward.

        </div>
        <p>
          Stand with feet together and crouch down by pushing hips back,
          keeping back flat and abs engaged. Jump as far as you can to the
          right, landing lightly on the ball of your right foot. Now jump as
          far as you can to the left, engaging glutes to push off. Land
          lightly on left foot.

        </div>
        <p>
          Stand on your right leg, slightly bending your knee. Keep your back
          flat as you hinge forward at the hips into a deadlift, sending left
          leg back behind you and arms below you.
          Lower only as far as you can without curving your back. Use your
          right hamstring and glute to stand. Repeat on the other side.
